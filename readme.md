The file Figxx.cpp are the simulation code.

Before you run those code, you should generate a network first.

You can use complete.cpp, regular.cpp, random_regular.cpp, scale_free.cpp and small_world.cpp to generate a network.

Their output is a $n \times n$ ( $n=100, i=0,1,... ,n-1$) matrix, which is corresponding to $w_{i,j}$.

To use fig2.cpp and fig3.cpp, you should run lambda.cpp and p.cpp respectively first.

Fig2.cpp needs the random activity strength as input and the input also contains the observed individual number (usally is $1$).

Fig3.cpp needs the random switching pattern as input.
